# 1. Data Exploration
Goal:
Inspect the raw landmark vectors to characterize value ranges, empirical distributions, inter-feature 
correlations, and outlier behavior.

Steps included:
- Data loading and cleaning
- Descriptive statistics for each feature
- Visualization of distributions
- Outlier analysis and discussion
- Feature scaling
- Correlation analysis
- Visualizations of correlations 

Results
- Statistical summaries provided insight into central tendency and spread
- Visualizations revealed distribution shapes and outlier behavior
- Outlier presence analyzed
- Correlations between features explored with heatmaps and network graphs
- Data prepared for further machine learning or statistical analysis
